# Optimized Delivery Route Planning with Fuel Management

## Project Overview
This project optimizes the delivery route of a van while considering fuel constraints and minimizing refueling stops. It calculates the shortest path between delivery locations, selects the best starting warehouse, and ensures efficient fuel management.

## Features
- **Optimal Warehouse Selection:** Determines the best warehouse to start the deliveries.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Finds the most efficient route between delivery locations.
- **Fuel Management:** Tracks fuel levels and identifies the nearest refueling stations when needed.
- **Route Printing:** Displays the final route, including refueling points, total distance traveled, and the number of refills.

## How It Works
1. **Input:** A set of warehouses, delivery locations, and gas stations with distances between them.
2. **Processing:**
   - Computes the shortest path between locations.
   - Selects the most optimal warehouse for starting the delivery.
   - Monitors fuel levels and plans refueling stops dynamically.
3. **Output:** An optimized route that minimizes distance and fuel stops.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Graph-based Shortest Path Computation
- **Data Structures:** Graphs, Priority Queues

## Use Cases
- Logistics and supply chain management
- Last-mile delivery route optimization
- Fuel-efficient transportation planning
